# Streambatch.io - Tutorials for Remote Sensing & Agriculture
This resource is intended to provide valuable guidance, tools, and resources to anyone interested in working with remote sensing data and vegetation indices like the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI).

Streambatch is a company that specializes in the processing of remote sensing data into valuable, analysis-ready metrics, such as NDVI. We've created this repository to serve as a hub for understanding the basics of these indices, and to provide practical examples of how to access and use open source data, such as Sentinel-2, via SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC).
